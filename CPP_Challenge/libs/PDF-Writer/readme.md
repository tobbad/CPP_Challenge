**Update 9/11/2019 Ending Support:**  
Hi All, after almost 9 years I decided to finish supporting PDFWriter. You may still use the code as is, with the provided license, however I will not be providing answers, solutions, responses etc.   
I'd like to thank everyone who used PDFWrtier and wish you all the best going forward with your projects.   
Gal.
