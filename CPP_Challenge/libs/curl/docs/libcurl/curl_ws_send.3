.TH curl_ws_send 3 "12 Jun 2022" "libcurl 7.85.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_ws_send - receive websocket data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/easy.h>

CURLcode curl_ws_send(CURL *curl, const void *buffer, size_t buflen,
                      size_t *sent, unsigned int sendflags);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function call is EXPERIMENTAL.

Send the specific message fragment over the established WebSocket connection.

If \fBCURLWS_RAW_MODE\fP is enabled in \fICURLOPT_WS_OPTIONS(3)\fP, the
\fBsendflags\fP argument should be set to 0.

.SH SENDFLAGS
.IP CURLWS_TEXT
The buffer contains text data. Note that this makes a difference to WebSocket
but libcurl itself will not make any verification of the content or
precautions that you actually send valid UTF-8 content.
.IP CURLWS_BINARY
This is binary data.
.IP CURLWS_NOCOMPRESS
No-op if thereâ€™s no compression anyway.
.IP CURLWS_CONT
This is not the final fragment of the message, which implies that there will
be another fragment coming as part of the same message where this bit is not
set.
.IP CURLWS_CLOSE
Close this transfer.
.IP CURLWS_PING
This as a ping.
.IP CURLWS_PONG
This as a pong.
